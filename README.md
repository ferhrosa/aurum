Personal finances manager project made on 2016.

This was third atempt the recreate the application, but, again, was never finished.

It was in a very initial version, so was never really used. 

Again, some new technologies was used:

* **Entity Framework**, with _Database First_ this time;
* A **SQL Server Database Project** to manage the database items;
* ASP.NET MVC on the back-end;
* **AngularJS** (v1.5) with _Angular Material_ on the front-end.
