This was first atempt the recreate the application, but was not very used and never really finished...

The idea was to use a SQL Server database to store the data and a web application (using ASP.NET WebForms) to do all the work.

But in the middle of the development we created a new WPF application, like the previous version. Then created a new web application using WebForms, and then created another new web application, but using ASP.NET MVC...

In summary, it was never going to be finished...
