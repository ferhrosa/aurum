# Aurum - 2014

Personal finances manager project made on 2014.

This was second atempt the recreate the application, but was never  finished.

It had some features already working, but was never hosted and really used for finances control.

For this version, some new technologies were used (compared to the previous version):

* **Entity Framework** with _Code First_ approach;
* ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API on the back-end;
* **Bootstrap** as styling and components framework;
* **Knockout** as a _MVVM_ library for a responsive front-end.
