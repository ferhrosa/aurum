# Aurum - 2011

Personal finances manager project made on 2011.

Developers:

This was the first version made for this system and the only one to be very well used. :)

It used a SQL Server database to store the data and a WPF program to do all the work.

---------------------

The solution contains also a WCF service and an Android project, but these was never finished (neither used).
